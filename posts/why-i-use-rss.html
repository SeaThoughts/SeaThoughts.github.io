                <h2>Why I Still Use RSS in 2025</h2>

                <p>Yes, you read that right. In an age of algorithmic feeds and 
                AI-curated content, I still use RSS feeds like it's 2005. And 
                you know what? It's fantastic.</p>
                
                <p>For those who weren't around during RSS's heyday (or have 
                forgotten), RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication." It's 
                basically a way to subscribe to websites and get updates without 
                having to manually check each one.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why RSS Still Rocks:</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Algorithm:</strong> I see everything, in chronological 
                    order. No mysterious algorithm deciding what I "should" see.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> RSS feeds don't track me, 
                    analyze my behavior, or build a profile to sell to advertisers.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Fast & Clean:</strong> Just the content, no ads, 
                    no comments, no "related articles" rabbit holes.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> No single company controls 
                    my information diet. If one site goes down, I still have hundreds 
                    of others.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>My current RSS setup includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal blogs (like this one!)</li>
                    <li>Niche tech sites</li>
                    <li>Local news sources</li>
                    <li>Comic strips (yes, really)</li>
                    <li>Academic journals in my field</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Sure, setting up RSS requires a bit more effort than just 
                opening an app. But the payoff is huge: you get back control 
                over your information consumption.</p>
                
                <p>Maybe it's time to bring back some of the old ways. Sometimes 
                "outdated" technology isn't outdated - it's just waiting for us 
                to remember why it was good in the first place.</p>
