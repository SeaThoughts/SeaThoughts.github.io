                <h2>Thursday 28th August</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">Posted on August 28, 2025 by Felipe</p>
                
                <p>Today is my sister's birthday. I am very happy to see my sisters and family even if it is through calls. It is always entertaining to see that we are more similar than we think. This week brought me many learnings about myself. I now understand, how hard it is to move to a new place. I have done it before, but never by myself. It is completely up to oneself, to make the place livable and lovable.</p>
                
                <p>For this, you have to spend a lot of money which I have done. More than 3000 dollars probably, just to get everything looking decent. I am still missing a sofa-bed for my visitors to stay at, and for myself to watch films. Films are a passion that I have developed over the past years. There are three films I am in desperate need of watching: 500 days of summer (just because Davi recommended it to me, and I am mesmerized by that human being), Happy Together and Suspiria. This third one I have no real reason why I want to watch it, but sometime about it calls me. Maybe it is that I can watch it for free in Amazon Prime. Only free if you disregard the 3 minutes ads that interrupt it in the beginning.</p>
                
                <p>I have 5 things, that I talked with Leandro about that encapsulate why I am feeling how I am. There is no order, but here I share them:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Joaos departure</li>
                    <li>My sisters departure</li>
                    <li>My distance with my parents</li>
                    <li>Adapting to Seattle</li>
                    <li>Making my house feel like a home</li>
                    <li>Loneliness</li>
                    <li>Marcos departure</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>I said 5 things, but while writing new things that bothered me were shown by my brain. The thing I can say to myself is paso a paso. Over 3 people have told me this. These 3 people love me and I listen carefully. Also, let's not forget that we can only accept life as it is, and there is no reason in fighting this fact. See you on a next entrance of the blog. Will share my pasta and tuna recipe and a couple of songs that I love. Trem das Onze, Apesar de voce.</p>
