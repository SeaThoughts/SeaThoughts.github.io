                <h2>Midnight Thoughts on Digital Minimalism</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">Posted on August 18, 2025 by Felipe</p>
                
                <p>It's 11:47 PM and I'm lying in bed, but instead of scrolling 
                through my phone like I used to, I'm writing this post on an old 
                laptop with a terrible keyboard. This is progress.</p>
                
                <p>Six months ago, I decided to try "digital minimalism" - basically, 
                being more intentional about how I use technology. Not a full 
                digital detox (I still need to work), but a conscious effort to 
                reduce the noise.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Changes I've made:</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Deleted social media apps from my phone</li>
                    <li>Set up specific times for checking email</li>
                    <li>Bought an actual alarm clock (goodbye, phone by the bed)</li>
                    <li>Started reading physical books again</li>
                    <li>Built this simple website instead of using platforms</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Unexpected benefits:</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>I sleep better (no blue light before bed)</li>
                    <li>Conversations are longer and deeper</li>
                    <li>I notice things - birds, architecture, people's expressions</li>
                    <li>My attention span is slowly recovering</li>
                    <li>I'm less anxious about... everything</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Don't get me wrong - technology is amazing. I'm literally using 
                it right now to share these thoughts with strangers on the internet. 
                But like any powerful tool, it's all about how you use it.</p>
                
                <p>The goal isn't to become a digital hermit. It's to be intentional. 
                To choose when and how technology serves you, instead of the other 
                way around.</p>
                
                <p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to turn off this laptop 
                and read a book made of actual paper. Revolutionary, I know.</p>
