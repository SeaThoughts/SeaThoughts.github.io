                <h2>My new Apartment in Seattle</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">Posted on August 27, 2025 by Felipe</p>
                
                <p>First, things first. Let's acknowledge the language that I am writing this in. I am no native speaker of English, yet I find myself in my new apartment in Seattle. It was my decision, it was everything I wanted, and I take every single bit of responsibility for being where I am. Yet, I still have the not so lingering feeling to complain. This is just the reminiscences of my upbringing, and therefore I refuse to fight with it today.</p>
                
                <p>I assume that my family and friends will manage to translate this into Spanish. The ones that don't speak the language I mean. I appreciate you being on my blog. By no means I want you to be entertained, and if you are, it is only a side effect. I might forget this in a couple of days, but today I have the energy and excitement to start something new.</p>
                
                <p>This is that I want to start, is my blog and artistic space on the web. I have a nostalgic love for old websites and I remember starting to create them in high school with my friends at puccinis class. I never understood why he didn't teach us about logic, real programming languages and so on. He only explained html, css and javascript, with javascript being the only real programming language.</p>
                
                <p>Okay, I am sorry I diverted a bit into my thoughts. Let's focus on what I actually wanted to talk about. That one thing is my life in August of 2025. I moved to a new country and my sister visited. The visiting was a surprise for both of us, as we got to know a new version of the people we love. This is not always easy, and many times it comes with its discussions and fights.</p>
                
                <p>Right now, almost everything in my apartment is already laid out. I am only missing a sofa bed for the living room and a shower curtain. The latter didn't prevent me from taking a shower today, which turned out to be a bad idea. My bathroom floor is wood, and I wonder if this is done for saving costs. I almost forgot, I am also missing a toaster. I will try to add photos, so you can see what I am talking about.</p>
                
                <p>Okay. I actually want people to read this, so this might be my last paragraph. Hopefully, next entrance I can focus on an actual topic, and not everything that comes to my mind. I have to develop the art of patience if I actually want to write something I like. Nonetheless, calling this a blog removes that burden of calling this a writing of mine. I hope you understand, what I mean.</p>
